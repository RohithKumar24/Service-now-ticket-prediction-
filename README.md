ServicesNow is a software company whose core business was to deal with management of incident, problem and change IT operational events, the current data set consists of incidents recorded in an IT company through ServiceNow platform.

Ticketing system is like a bridge between customers and the service company to deal with the issues faced by customers. Whenever an issue is observed, the customer reports it and an incident regarding that is recorded in the ticketing system. Ticketing system helps to assign the ticket to a particular group based on the label and priority, it also comes
in handy when there are huge tickets raised by customers regarding a specific i ssue,  t segments the issue and assigns it to a particular group. All i  well and good but we do not know how much time it will take to resolve the ticket, the customer waits until the ticket is resolved, sometimes it might be longer than expected which can even make them lose the trust on the service company, if we can predict the time of closing the ticket, we can tell the time of closing to the customers beforehand which will be useful to the customers and the company too.
